# LeetCode by Paredev

Welcome to my LeetCode Practice repository! This project is all about sharpening my data structures and algorithms skills through solving LeetCode problems. This repository is organized to help anyone preparing for software engineering interviews, improving problem-solving abilities, or simply enjoying the challenge of algorithmic puzzles.

## Introduction

This repository is structured around different programming topics, such as Arrays, LinkedLists, and Sorting algorithms, with an emphasis on practicing and understanding a wide range of data structures and algorithms. Each topic is further organized by difficulty level: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders representing major programming concepts or topics, each of which contains subfolders for difficulty levels. Here's a general overview of the structure:

### Folder and File Naming

- **Topic Folders**: Directly reflect the main concept or data structure the problems are related to (e.g., `Arrays`, `LinkedLists`).
- **Difficulty Subfolders**: Each topic folder contains three subfolders - `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`, categorizing the problems based on their difficulty level.
- **Solution Files**: Are named with the LeetCode problem number followed by the problem title, making it easy to search for specific solutions (e.g., `001_TwoSum.py`)
